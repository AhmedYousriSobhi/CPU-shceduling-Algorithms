# CPU-shceduling-Algorithms
CPU scheduling algorithms "FCFS: First-come-first-serve, RR: Round Robin" implementation and simulating their performance in some test process cases.

## Instructions:
    First, user enter the file name and its extention, then, choose whether uses FCFS algorithm or RR algorithm.

## The output is:
    1-Termination time, Waiting time and Turnaround time for each process.
    2-Average Waiting Time and Average Turnaround Time for all process.
